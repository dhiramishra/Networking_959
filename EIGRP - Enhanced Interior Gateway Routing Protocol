EIGRP - Enhenced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol.
----------------------------------------------------

-> EIGRP is also called Hybrid Routing Protocol.
-> It is called IGP > Adv. distance vector routing protocol which is more powerfull as comparision to RIP.
-> It work within an ASN(Autonomous System No.)
-> Organization has its ASN number which is assigned by IANA.
-> EIGRP support VLSM and Summery of IP address.
-> EIGRP denoted by 'D' in Routing table.
-> EIGRP uses 'metric' to select best route in network.
-> Metric is calculated based on the 'K-Value', by default on cisco router the K-value is K1+K3 runs.

K-Value
---------------
K1 - Bandwidth
K2 - Load
K3 - Delay
K4 - Relialbility
K5 - MTU

1. How to enable EIGRP on Cisco Routers.

Before enable EIGRP insure your IP address configured on interfaces (recommended).

#Enable EIGRP 
------------------------
R1(Config)# router eigrp <ASN>
R1(Config)# router eigrp 100

Ensure each and every router must be configured with the same ASN, otherwise EIGRP won't be in effect.

#Configure Router ID (Optional)
------------------------------------
After enable EIGRP you can configure the Router ID, if you does not configure it has other option to select Router ID automatically.

Router ID
	1. Highest physical address of interfaces.
	2. Highest Loopback address of Interfaces.
	3. Manually configure the router id.

Manually configure the Router ID
--------------------------------------
R1(Router-config)# Router-ID <32-bit router id>
R1(router-config)# Router-id 1.1.1.1

Note : If you configure the manual router-id then other option will be not considered becuase manually router-id has highest preferences.

#Network Command - Configured advertised network.
----------------------------------------------------
-> 3rd step is configure the networks which you want to advertised in your  network.
-> when you configure the EIGRP advertised those network with others connected hops within the same ASN.

<Syntex> Network <network_address><wildcard_mask>

R1(router-config)# network 203.0.11.0 0.0.0.255
R1(router-config)# network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255


#EIGRP Multicast Address 
--------------------------
EIGRP uses multicast address 224.0.0.10 to adverties 'Hello/Update' packet to others hops.

#EIGRP Tables 
--------------------------
	1. Neighbor Table 
	2. Topology Table 
	3. Routing Table


#EIGRP - Neighbor Table 
------------------------
-> EIGRP create neighborship table with exchange the 'Hello' Packet.
-> EIGRP multicast 'hello' packet on multicast address 224.0.0.10 to all directly connected link.
-> Hello timer packet has 5 second, and hold timer has 15 second.

Hello - neighborship parameters 
--------------------------------
-> K-Value must be same on each router if change, otherwise by default it has K1+K3 (Bandwidth + Delay).

If both parameters are match then the hello packet will be exchange with directly connected router to form a neighborship table.

1. Once R1 get response of the 'hello' packet then R1 send an 'empty-update' packet to R2(Suppose we have 2 routers).

2. Empty-Update has only the Sequence number then R2 will response also an empty update response to R1.

3. Now R1 will share the full database information to R2 with the unicat update, this update packet has full information of the networks.

Note only first time full databases shared by R1 in full update(Unicast) packet, after the whenever the R1 send any update packet it has 
only partial update (Multicast) packet which refer only changes in topology.

4. Table fields : Handle, Neighbor-Address, connected interface, Holddown time, Uptime, SRTT, RTO, Q Count and Swq. Number.


#EIGRP - Topology Table
-------------------------
-> Topology table has complete information of entire network topogy, all availble routes to reach one destination to other.

-> In the topology table metric is calculated, as we know EIGRP uses metric to select the best route.
-> Metric is calculated based on the K-Value.

Metric
--------

Formula : (10^7 / B.W + total delay / 10) * 256

or

Formula : (10^7 / Least B.W + Total Delay /10) * 256

There are two types of metric in EIGRP.
	1. Classic Mode (32-Bit) - [ K-Value : K1, K2, K3, K4, K5]
		A. Fixed Metric 
		B. Variable Metric

	2. Named Mode (64-Bit) - [K-Value : K1, K2, K3, K4, K5, K6]
		
	-> Name mode metric has one extra K-Value which is called 'Extended Metric'.

Table Field : Code (Active, passive), Prefix, Feasible Distance/Advertised Distance, Connected Interface.

#EIGRP - Routing Table
-------------------------
-> Contain all best routes from EIGRP topology table and other routing protocols.

Table Field : Protocol code, prefix, Metric, Advertiesed Distance, Next Hop.

#EIGRP - DUAL Algorithm
-----------------------------
-> EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is a routing protocol that uses the DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm) algorithm to calculate the best path and maintain routing information in the routing table.

-> The DUAL algorithm is a loop-free routing protocol that provides fast convergence and efficient use of network bandwidth. It calculates the shortest path to a destination based on the lowest metric value, which is a combination of bandwidth, delay, reliability, load, and MTU (maximum transmission unit) of the path.

-> DUAL also maintains multiple feasible successors for a destination, which ensures that there is always an alternative path available in case of a failure in the primary path. This results in fast convergence and reduced downtime in the network.

Important Facts about DUAL Algorithm
----------------------------------------

1. Feasible Distance
2. Advertised Distance (Reported Distance)
3. Successor 
4. Feasible Successor
